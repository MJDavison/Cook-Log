## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

CookLog is a website used to display cooking videos. The intent behind the website is to provide a way for me to record others cook (with permission...) and later look at it to learn how to cook the meals myself, rather than having to remember everything or trust in making notes on the go.

This is an experiment. The website won't be publicly available- I value my privacy- but you're welcome to link the website up to your own database and do the same!
